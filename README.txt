The application is divided into two directories, Server and Client. In the server directory you will find all the files that are used for the backend and in the client directory you will find all the files that are used for the frontend.

In the root directory you can find this readme file and our report of the project. The report includes design description, use cases, a manual, as well as an API specification.
